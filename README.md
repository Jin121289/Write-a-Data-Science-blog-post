## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries: </br>
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

You can download Stackoverflow’s 2017 and 2018 Annual Developer Survey and put in specific folders. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). </br>

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project where I explored the Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to gain insights into the following questions regarding Japan:
1. Which programming languages are most commonly used, and which are most in demand?
2. What are the most wanted programming languages in Japan?
3. How does the programming languages used at work relate to the programming languages people want to learn?
